The Weather Forecasting app is a user-friendly React.js application that allows users to easily search for weather information by city name, displaying detailed forecasts for the next 5-6 days at 3-hour intervals. Built with Material-UI for a sleek and responsive design, this app leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to provide accurate and up-to-date weather data and with future enhancements planned—such as TypeScript conversion, geolocation features, and dark/light mode—it promises to deliver an even more comprehensive weather experience.
